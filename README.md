# DayPlanner
* Simple day planner/task keeping app.

## Description
I created a simple container and grid layout for creating a responsive day planner app with Bootstrap elements. I used JavaScript, moment.js and jQuery to create simple variables, loops, and functions.
* set date to top of page
* created job object to hold tasks
* created a function to create task in corresponding row
* created an update function with a loop to modify classList with dynamic time update from moment.js.
* created a get function to load tasks to row
* created a set function to add tasks to localStorage
* created a replace function to make text entry a p element and persist data
* created click function for the tasks to allow input
* created on click for save button to save input 
* created on click for clear button to clear localStorage and refresh page. 

## Uses
